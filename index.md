## Introduction

This course introduces the **architecture** of digital systems, emphasising structural principles common to a wide range of technologies, including:
* Multi-level implementation strategies
* Definition of new primitives (e.g., gates, instructions, procedures, and processes), and 
* Their mechanisation using lower-level elements. 

By the end of this course, you're also expected to know about: 
* Analysis of potential concurrency and precedence constraints, and performance measures.
* Instruction set design issues and architectural support for contemporary software structures.

All lesson materials: **lecture notes**, **problem sets**, and **FPGA tutorials** can be found in the tabs above. Please refer to the **50.002 course handout** (link in edimension) to obtain the links to our lab handouts. 

We have also recorded [lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLklpDKpv-EBj1agIq4vB1iB6ahMT8_2A_) and [post-lecture videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLklpDKpv-EBhCVUAZDDRWEGZzR_It-FSo) for each topic. The links to the individual videos can be found in the respective lecture notes. 

*Have fun!*
